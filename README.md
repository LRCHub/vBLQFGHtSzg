# Charlie Puth – Up All Night

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Well I get a thrill run down my spine
When I see you hittin' me up
Feelin' so electrified like the heat
of a million suns
You know just one touch can
keep me high
And I think I'll never come down
Till a couple days go by and you're
nowhere to be found
Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me
yesterday playin' over in my mind
Its a crime
Its a crime
How you reeling me in with
the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry
So I tried to shake you out my head
Tried to dance with somebody new
But you got those lips so red
And that smokey voice you do
So I know its pointless anyway
Cause there ain't nobody else
That could light me up so bright
And break this crazy spell
Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me
yesterday playin' over in my mind
Its a crime
Its a crime
How you reeling me in with
the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry
If I wait a little longer then maybe
you'll come back around
Wait a little longer then maybe
you'll be ready now
Cause I could wait forever for you
to fall back into my arms
So come on
Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me
yesterday playin' over in my mind
Its a crime
Its a crime
How you reeling me in with
the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry
How you reeling me in with
the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry
